# OULAD Data Warehouse and Analytics Pipeline

An end-to-end data engineering project using the **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)** to transform raw learning data into a structured analytical data warehouse and generate insights into student engagement, assessment performance, withdrawal, and course activity.

Built using **Databricks, Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, SQL, and Python**.

---

## Project Overview

The pipeline follows a **Medallion Architecture** to progressively transform and prepare the OULAD data for analytics.

The project focuses on:

* Reliable ingestion of OULAD source data
* Data cleaning and standardization
* Data-quality validation
* Dimensional data modeling
* Student engagement and performance analysis
* Business-oriented analytics

## Key Findings

| Business Area                | Key Finding                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Engagement & Performance** | Assessment submission rate does not show a clear linear relationship with average assessment score. Scores remain around **70.5–72.8** across engagement groups. |
| **Withdrawal Patterns**      | Withdrawn students score approximately **10–11 points lower** and submit fewer assessments (**~2.8 vs. ~7.3**).                                                  |
| **Course Activity**          | Active students decrease from approximately **28K to 14K** as the course progresses, while activity increases around assessment periods.                         |
| **Module Engagement**        | **FFF** has the highest average VLE engagement at **1,800+ clicks per student**, while **CCC** has the lowest at approximately **650**.                          |

### Main Takeaways

* Higher assessment participation does **not automatically mean higher scores**.
* Lower assessment participation is strongly associated with **student withdrawal**.
* Student activity changes throughout the course, particularly around **assessment periods**.
* Engagement varies significantly across **course modules**.
* Multiple engagement indicators should be considered rather than relying on a single metric.

# Pipeline Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| **Source Inspection** | Validates incoming OULAD files before ingestion | Checks expected/unexpected files, detects missing or empty files, records source row counts, and establishes a data-quality baseline |
| **Bronze** | Stores the raw source data in Delta tables | Preserves source structure, adds ingestion metadata, and provides the foundation for downstream processing |
| **Silver** | Creates clean and standardized datasets | Standardizes data types and categories, handles missing/sentinel values, applies business rules, and removes duplicates or invalid records |
| **Gold** | Creates the analytical data warehouse | Builds fact and dimension tables, uses surrogate keys, defines fact grain, and retains source identifiers for traceability |
| **Analytics** | Uses Gold data to answer business questions | Analyzes student engagement and performance, withdrawal patterns, course activity, and module-level engagement |
---

# Gold Data Model

The Gold layer consists of **two fact tables** and **five dimensions**.

## Fact Tables

| Fact Table             | Grain                                                 | Main Measures        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `fact_assessment`      | One row per student-course-assessment-submission date | `score`, `is_banked` |
| `fact_vle_interaction` | One row per student-course-site-relative date         | `sum_click`          |

## Dimension Tables

| Dimension        | Grain                           | Purpose                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `dim_student`    | One row per student-course      | Student and course presentation attributes |
| `dim_course`     | One row per course presentation | Course and module information              |
| `dim_assessment` | One row per assessment          | Assessment type, date, and weight          |
| `dim_vle`        | One row per VLE site per course | VLE resource and activity information      |
| `dim_date`       | One row per relative day        | Course-relative date and week information  |

# Star Schema

```text
                         dim_student
                              │
                              ▼
                       fact_assessment
                       /      │       \
                      ▼       ▼        ▼
               dim_course  dim_assessment  dim_date


                         dim_student
                              │
                              ▼
                    fact_vle_interaction
                     /       │        \
                    ▼        ▼         ▼
              dim_course   dim_vle   dim_date
```

The star schema separates **measurable events** in the fact tables from **descriptive attributes** in the dimension tables, making the data easier to query and analyze.

---

# Relative Date Design

OULAD uses **relative days** rather than conventional calendar dates.

Examples:

```text
-30 → 30 days before the course reference point
  0 → Course reference point
+10 → 10 days after the reference point
```

The pipeline uses a shared `dim_date` based on these relative days.

This allows student assessment and VLE activity to be compared based on **course progress**, even when different course presentations have different schedules.

---

## Decisions

The architecture of the pipeline relies on key design decisions to guarantee reliable and scalable data processing. Below is a brief overview; for in-depth documentation, proceed to [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md).

* The pipeline is separated into Source, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Analytics layers to isolate ingestion, transformation, modeling, and analysis.
* Delta tables provide reliable storage, allowing for safe reruns and incremental updates without duplicating data.
* The Bronze layer preserves the raw source structure, while the Silver layer handles all data cleaning, type standardization, and deduplication.
* Surrogate keys map facts to dimensions in the Gold layer, enforcing a strict fact grain to prevent incorrect aggregations.
* The time dimension tracks activity based on course-relative days instead of standard calendar dates to align with the OULAD dataset.

---

## Data Validation

Validation checks are applied at every layer of the pipeline to identify issues early and ensure the final analytics are based on reliable data. Below is a brief overview; for in-depth documentation, proceed to [`docs/validation.md`](docs/validation.md).

* Source and Bronze layer checks verify that all expected files are present, not empty, and successfully ingested with the correct columns and row counts.
* Silver layer checks enforce data quality by verifying required fields, standardizing data types, validating numeric ranges, and removing duplicates.
* Gold layer checks validate the dimensional model by confirming dimension keys, foreign key relationships, and fact table grain.
* Analytics layer checks ensure the final output aligns with business rules, maintains the correct analytical grain, and properly handles null values.
